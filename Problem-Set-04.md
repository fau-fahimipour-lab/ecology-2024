# Introduction
Species richness and diversity provide essential insights into community structure and can help us evaluate the impacts of environmental changes. In this exercise, we will use these ecological metrics to assess the potential effects of human industrial activities on the freshwater fish community in a hypothetical large river in Central Chile - referred to as the "Central Chilean River."

In regions like these river basins, freshwater fish communities exhibit remarkable species richness and diversity. Even in relatively small waterways, it's not uncommon to find over 200 different species. However, our focus is on the (hypothetica) Central Chilean River, which boasts the highest native species richness of all the rivers within this hypothetical region, housing 17 distinct native species. Suppose that many of these species are endemic to the rivers of Central Chile, and some are classified as threatened or endangered.

The Central Chilean River serves as a crucial resource for human activities, including drinking water supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and various industrial uses. Since approximately 1995, human utilization of this river has experienced a significant upswing. We aim to investigate species richness and diversity patterns across four distinct zones along the river to discern any potential impacts stemming from these human developments on the fish community.

In the table below, you will find a list of hypothetical fish species discovered in the Central Chilean River. The columns labeled Zone 1 to Zone 4 correspond to the number of individuals of each species observed in these zones. Zone 1 designates the most *upstream* locations, while Zone 4 designates the most *downstream* location.

|   Species Name                 |   Zone 1  |   Zone 2  |   Zone 3  |   Zone 4  |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

|   Galaxias macalatus           |   23      |   40      |   6       |   2       |
|   Percichthys melanops         |   1       |   1       |   0       |   0       |

|   Nematogenys inermis          |   0       |   0       |   0       |   2       |
|   **Total**                    |   740     |   226     |   106     |   202     |

## Question 1
Calculate [i] species richness and [ii] the Shannon diversity for each of the 4 zones (*show your calculations*). Is the pattern of variation among zones in species richness the same as the pattern in diversity? What do differences in these patterns indicate to you?

## Question 2
In relatively undisturbed rivers, we usually expect richness and diversity to *increase* from upstream locations to downstream locations. Is the current pattern in our hypothetical river consistent with this expectation? What factors might cause a deviation from the typical pattern?

## Question 3
Suppose the species *Galaxias macalatus* goes extinct across the **entire** river. Which zone's diversity would be most strongly affected? Explain why.

## Question 4
Envision and describe a scenario where *species richness* (and not *Shannon diversity*) would be a more useful measurement for conservation efforts?
